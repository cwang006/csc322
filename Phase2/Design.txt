  Phase II: Design Report
 
This report is meant to provide the data structure and logic to
carry out the functionalities dictated by the specification. Keep
in mind that the implementation will be entirely based on this document.
adequate details should thus be given at length.
 
Deadline: Apr. 11 (F), 11:59 pm, via the 322 report upload portal

 1. Introduction
    An overall picture of the system using a collaboration class diagram 

 2. All use cases
    o Scenarios for each use case: normal AND exceptional scenarios
    o Collaboration or sequence class diagram for each use case, choose 
      3 or more use cases: draw the Petri-nets instead of class diagrams

 3. E/R diagram for the entire system
    The attributes and key for each class should be provided

 4. Detailed design:
    For EVERY method, use pseudo-code to delineate the input/output and
    main functionalities

 5. System screens:
    demonstrate major GUI screens of the system and a sample prototype of one
    functionality of your own choice.

 6. Memos of group meetings and possible concerns about teamwork

 7. Address of the git repo (github, GitLab, bitbucket, etc) of your 
    team's work so far - put all materials, including this report.
